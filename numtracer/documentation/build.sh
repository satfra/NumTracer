# Build the NumTracer documentation site (C++ API + narrative pages).
#
# Steps, in order:
#   1. Run Doxygen on the C++ headers -> HTML inside the Sphinx source tree.
#   2. Run doxysphinx to wrap the Doxygen HTML as Sphinx documents.
#   3. Run sphinx-build to produce the final site.
#
# Usage: build.sh [OUTPUT_DIR]   (default: <documentation>/_build)
#
# Requirements (see requirements.txt): doxygen, plus a Python 3.9–3.12
# environment with sphinx, pydata-sphinx-theme, myst-parser, sphinx-design and
# doxysphinx installed.
